# Image-to-.cur-hex-converter
A python script that converts any image to .cur hex files. I wanted to replace a mouse cursor in an exe.

The "Image-To-HEX" script has a block of code that was meant to not go over or under the original HEX length. Basically it forced the image input down to 32x32 resolution. I have just turned it into a multi-line comment in case you just want to see how the HEX of your image looks!
